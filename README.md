FinTech Case Study
---
## Overview and Origin  
**Company Name:**  
Albert Investments  
**Date of incorporation:**  
Albert Investments is an SEC registered investment advisory firm with an effective registration date of 12/3/2018.  
**Founders:**  
Albert Corp which owns Albert Investments was founded by Yinon Ravid and Andrzej Baraniak. Yinon Ravid is the CEO of Albert Investments.  
**How did the idea for the company come about?:**  
After many a family get-together in which he was asked finance questions, Yinon founded Albert on the idea of having a smart friend you could ask any money question.  
In the first few years of the company's existance Albert relied on Betterment for investment advice. However, with the launch of Albert Investments now the company maintains the relationship with their customer versus referring the customer to Betterment.  
**How is the company been funded? How much funding have they received?**  
On January 26, 2021 the company closed a Series C round in which $100M was raised. This brings the company's total funding to $172.9M. Prior to the Series C, Albert had Series A and Series B rounds as well as three Seed rounds and one Pre Seed round. This indicates that a most if not all of the company's funding has been from investors.  
### Business Activities:  
**What specific problem is the company trying to solve?**  
Historicially over the long term savings accounts have not outperformed inflation. This means that a savings account will not  
help one build wealth. As a matter of fact, leaving money in a savings account over the long term will actually reduce one's  
purchasing power. For the majority of us the only true way to grow our wealth is to invest in the stock and bond markets.  
However, investing in the markets can be quite scary. This is where Albert Investments portfolio by Genius offers a solution.  
Portfolio by Genius is Albert Investmetns version of a robo-advisor in with the customer answers a few questions about their  
goals, risk tolerance and time horizon and then receive a recommended portfolio of ETFs. Albert Investments also has an offering  
for those customers who a self-managed account. However, this is not your typical self-managed account where you pick your own  
stocks or ETFs. The Albert Investments self-managed account allows the customer to pick holdings from a curated list of themes.  
Whether the customer chooses portfolio by Genius or a self-managed account the problem that Albert Investments solves is how to  
help Americans grow their wealth.  
**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this customer?**  
Albert Corp the parent company of Albert Investments targets younger, mobile users. So it stands to reason that Albert  
Investments target customer doesn't stray to far from that group. However, given that investment accounts are generally targeted  
toward more affluent individuals it seems reasonable to assume that Albert Investments is moving a little up market when compared  
to Albert Corp's original target customer.  
**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?**  
When compared to Betterment, it is clear that Albert Investments is a newish player in the robo-advisory space. Where Betterment  
has multiple account types, like individual accounts, joint accounts, trust accounts and IRA accounts; it appears that Albert currently only offers  
individual and joint accounts. This indicates that Albert Investments is currently only focusing on taxable accounts for their customers.  
However, Albert Investments does seem to have a unique take on servicing its customer with access to Albert Geniuses. These are professionals  
that can help answer questions and Portfolio by Genius is Albert Investments' robo-advisory offering.  
**Which technologies are the currently using and how are they implementing them?**  
For analytics and tracking Albert uses CrazyEgg, Branch, New Relic, Google Analytics, Facebook Domain Insights, Facebook Pixel, Facebook Conversion  
Tracking and Facebook Signal.  
For Widgets Alberts uses Google Font API, Lever, Dropbox Business, WebEx Panel, and Font Awesome.  
Python and Heroku Vegur Proxy are used in for Frameworks.  
Viewport Meta, iPhone/Mobile Compatible, and Mobile Non Scalealbe Content are all used for Mobile.  
Content delivery is handled by Vimeo CDN, Google Static Content, and AWS CloudFront.  
Payments processing is handled by MasterCard.  
JavaScript libraries and functions are handled by jQuery, Froogaloop, Facebook for Websites, Facebook SDK.  
Web hosting is provided by AWS EC2.  
SSL certificates are handled by Sectigo SSL, Sectigo Domain SSL, and SSL by Default.  
#### Landscape:  
**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**  
Albert Investments is in the wealth management domain, specifically robo-advisory.  
**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**  
The last 5-10 years has seen the rise and acceptance of the robo-advisory domain. Robo-advice disrupted the wealth  
management insdustry by offering lower cost diversified portfolios and lower minimums which dramatically increased the accessibilty of  
wealth management services. The proliferation and acceptance of low cost exchange traded funds (ETFs) along with the automation of some portfolio managment processes  
allowed robo-advisors to construct and manage diversified risk based portfolios at a much lower cost than traditional advisor managed portfolios. The robo-advisors  
passed this cost savings to the end customer. Today robo-advice has been widely accepted by both the investing public and traditional financial services firms.  
One only need to look at Schwab's Intelligent portfolios or Fidelity Go as examples of traditional financial services firm's acceptance and assimilation of robo-advice.  
**What are the other major companies in this domain?**  
As previously mentioned many of the traditional financial services firms have assimilated the robo-advice domain. Traditional firms like Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, and  
J.P. Morgan all have some form of a robo-advisor. There are also the independent robo-advisors like Betterment, one of the first robo-advisors, Wealthfront, Personal Capital, and  
Ellevest.  
##### Results:  
**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**  
From my perspective the purpose of Albert Investments is to round out the financial services offerings of Albert Corp and retain customers who are investing ready rather than  
refer them to Betterment. From that perspective Albert Investments is making progress. However, when evaluating Albert Investments as a stand alone robo-advisor there is room  
for improvement.  
**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**  
Consistent with the rest of the wealth management space, the core metric of robo-advisors is discretionary assets under management (AUM). This represents the total dollar amount  
the firm manages on a discretionary basis. Additional metrics that might be of interest are number of discretionary accounts and AUM per discretionary account.  
As of its most recent filing with the SEC, Albert Investments has discretionary AUM of roughly $1.5M, 15,634 discretionary accounts which corresponds to roughly $96  
per discretionary account.  
Betterment's, the generally accepted leader in the robo-advisory space, numbers are $18B in AUM, 660,195 discretionary accounts which corresponds to over $27,000 per discretionary  
account.  
When comparing Albert Investment's numbers to Betterment's numbers it's clear Albert has a long way to go before it will compete with the top players in the space.  
###### Recommendations:  
**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**  
As of this writing, Albert Investments only offers taxable brokerage accounts and does not offer retirement accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs).  
**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
Albert Investments tends to target younger investers. In terms of the hierarchy of accounts that a younger should open, taxable brokerage accounts generally should opened after retirement accounts.  
Albert Investments would improve its AUM and product offering by including IRAs as a type of account that could be opened. The retirement prospect for many Americans is bleak and Albert could help its customers improve their prospect for retirement by offering IRAs. Additionally, when people change jobs many don't want to leave their 401k with their previous employer. By offering IRAs, Albert could help its customers by allowing them transfer their retirement funds to Albert by using a tax free rollover. This could be good for Albert's customers because their retirement funds would be managed by professional and good for Albert because it would increase AUM.  
**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**  
For the most part an IRA account should leverage many of the existing technologies that Albert Investments already uses. However, there are additional tax reporting responsibilities when offering IRAs and  
Albert would need to track things like the amount of contributions, distributions, rollovers, traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions, and recharacterizations. As such, Albert would need to implement  
some sort of tax management software that would allow it to report specific tax related retirement account actions to the IRS. Other than that, Albert should be able to leverage existing technologies to  
manage the other aspects of IRA accounts.  
**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**  
The main difference between taxable brokerage accounts and IRAs are the tax guidelines that govern IRAs. Implementing an IRA tax management software would allow Albert Investments to offer IRAs and thus  
increase its product offering and grow AUM.
